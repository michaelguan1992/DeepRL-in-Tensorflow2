# DeepRL-in-Tensorflow2
Recently, Google releases their next generation end-to-end open source machine learning platform Tensorflow 2.0 (March 2019), and back in September 2018, OpenAI releases a beginner-level tutorial series of reinforcement learing called Spinning Up in Deep RL. I love these two project, and one thought came to my mind: why not re-implement the spinning up deep RL algorithms with Tensorflow 2.0? It may also benefits beginners. What a thought!

I don't provide a setup.py file just because
Setup:
Install OpenMPI:
For Ubuntu:
>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev


For Mac OS X, you need to install Homebrew, and then
>brew install openmpi

Required python packages:
(1) Tensorflow 2.0 alpha
(2) Tensorflow probability nightly
(3) gym
(4) mpi4py
(5) matplotlib
(6) jupyter notebook/lab
